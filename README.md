# Custom Car Loader (CCL)

A mod for Derail Valley that allows the creation of custom rolling stock and locomotives. The mod is still under development, thus bugs and idiosyncrasies are to be expected. You can use the car creation package to setup a car in Unity and export it as an assetbundle, which can then be loaded into Derail Valley and spawned in-game. The cars can be spawned with the Comms Radio using the standard Car Spawner menu.

The [original project](https://github.com/Freznosis/DVCustomCarLoader) was created by Freznosis.

## Improving CCL

Before opening pull requests, developers should build and test their changes locally to make sure everything is working as expected.

### Environment Setup

After cloning the repository, some setup is required in order to successfully build the mod DLLs. This guide assumes Visual Studio is used for development and the `DVCustomCarLoader` solution has already been opened.

> **Note:** The reference paths will be saved locally to `*.csproj.user` files. These files should not be committed as the reference paths may differ between each developer's environment. Git should already be set up to ignore these files.

### Build Output

The output DLLs will need to be copied into `Derail Valley install directory > Mods > DVCustomCarLoader` each time the solution is built. Copy them from `bin\Debug` or `bin\Release` depending on the selected build configuration.
